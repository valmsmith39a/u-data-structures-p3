## Explanation

### Discussion

The key idea for this problem was to insert the 0s and 2s in the correct positions,
and that process would result in the correct placement of the 1s as well.

### Time and Space Complexity

In this solution, we traverse the array once, so the running time is O(n).
The sorting is accomplished in-place, so the space complexity is O(1).
